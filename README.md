# Starfinder GM-Helper

## Premise
The idea of the Starfinder GM-Helper is to assist anybody who is running their own game of the Starfinder tabletop RPG as the game master.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, you can create randomly generated encounters based on the average party level or a randomly generated NPC based on various inputs.<br/>
