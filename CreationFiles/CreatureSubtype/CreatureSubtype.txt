Generally, a subtype graft grants a few traits, but for particularly powerful subtypes (such as devil), you
might want to monitor how many abilities the subtype gives your NPC and avoid adding extra special abilities
of the same type that the subtype graft already provides (usually immunities, resistances, and spell-like
abilities).
